## What is Flask?
Flask is a web application framework written in Python. It is developed by Armin Ronacher, who leads an international group of Python enthusiasts named Pocco. Flask is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. Both are Pocco projects.

## Flask â€“ Environment
## Prerequisite
Python 2.6 or higher is usually required for installation of Flask. Although Flask and its dependencies work well with Python 3 (Python 3.3 onwards), many Flask extensions do not support it properly. Hence, it is recommended that Flask should be installed on Python 2.7.
