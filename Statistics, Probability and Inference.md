## Importance of Statistics for Data Science

Most Data Scientists always invest more in pre-processing of data. This requires a good understanding of statistics. There are few general steps that always need to be performed to process any data.

Identify the importance of features by using various statistical tests.
Finding the relationship between features to eliminate the possibility of duplicate features.
Converting the features into the required format.
Normalizing and scaling the data. This step also involves the identification of the distribution of data and the nature of data.
Taking the data for further processing by using required adjustments in the data.
After processing the data identify the right mathematical approach/model.
Once the results are obtained the results are verified on the different accuracy measurement scales.
