- Deep learning is one of the major subfield of machine learning framework. Machine learning is the study of design of algorithms, inspired from the model of human brain. 
- Deep learning is becoming more popular in data science fields like robotics, artificial intelligence(AI), audio & video recognition and image recognition. Artificial neural network is the core of deep learning methodologies. Deep learning is supported by various libraries such as Theano, TensorFlow, Caffe, Mxnet etc., Keras is one of the most powerful and easy to use python library, which is built on top of popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow, Theano, etc., for creating deep learning models.
